        <br><p id='photocaption'>The finished book, containing 22 different designers work</p><br>
    <p>Visual Visionaries was created by my sophomore fall communication design class, each student was tasked with selected a designer, writing a biography on said designer and creating a set of spreads inspired by the designer. I selected El Lissitzky - a true visionary, a revolutionary. El Lissitzky was a influential role in the development of Suprematism and in Russian design in general.</p><br>

  <img src="ellissitzky/ellissitzkyspread.jpg" res width="65%" height="100%" >
        <br>  <p id='photocaption'>I was greatly interested in Lissitzky’s use of geometric shapes and white space </p>  <br>

        <br><p id='photocaption'>The purpose of this project was our first attempt at following a rigid structure that we developed and that would be consistent throughout</p>    <br>
    <img src="ellissitzky/ellissitzkyspread3.jpg" res width="65%" height="100%" >
        <br> <p id='photocaption'>The large amounts of negative space and the utilization of the red boxes quotes are inspired by the Soviet style that first drew me to selecting Lissitzky</p>   <br>
<p>When developing his spreads, I was inspired by his story - his rebellion against the existing schools at the time as well as common conceptions of art and design. El Lissitzky was always changing, always moving - always bold. Lissitzky enjoyed the experimentation of form and how it related to one another through materials and what spiritual and aesthetic emotions it would bring up in an individual. </p>

        <br><p id='photocaption'>For the web piece I wanted to have the same air of negative space and free space that influenced Lissitzky’s work</p><br>
<p>The second part of this project was to create a website using HTML/ CSS; my goal was to follow this ever-changing and always bold and moving sense that I attempted to create in the spreads in a different platform.

<img src="ellissitzky/process1.gif" res width="65%" height="100%" ><br><p id='photocaption'>My first spread iterations, these were inconsistent throughout - looking back I am glad I combated my stubbornness and allowed myself to advance</p><br>
<p>My initial concept was to create overlapping images with text as I wanted to copy his geometric shape work as well as his seemly geometric transitions, however, this went against the backbone of the project. By having no consistency I was not following the guidelines of the project and not advancing in knowledge on grids. I soon realized that all successful documents have a grid, even if they are difficult to see at first, and one must learn the structure of a grid before breaking it.</p>
<br>
<img src="ellissitzky/process2.gif" res width="65%" height="100%" ><br><p id='photocaption'>My later iterations, after I created a grid and style guide throughout I played with breaking it effectively </p><br>
<p>After I stopped “fighting” the project I set on creating a 2 column structure that was consistent throughout. I took a break, I stepped back and as soon as I fixed all the small issues within my spreads I began working on how to make the spreads more dynamic and exciting. I ended on housing large quotes in red boxes, which referenced his work. If I were to further iterate on this project I think I would begin playing with text being less rigid, maybe even on angles.
