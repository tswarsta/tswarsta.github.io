    <h1>CONTEXT</h1><p>PORCELAIN BABY stems from my personal frustration with creating art and how it has also become both a hunt and a struggle to generate something original. I have come to terms [almost] with the idea that nothing can be formed originally; however, new combinations that are successful will be viewed with the same light as something original. </p><p>Throughout this book you will find highly saturated colors as well as text that has been reshaped. I intend for these elements to still work together, but to serve as an impactful distraction to the viewer.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_4">
	<h1>STRATEGY</h1><p>The phrase “Porcelain Baby” is an oxymoron in itself - porcelain, which was first developed in China and spread through East Asia and eventually to Europe; is one of the most prestigious types of pottery, and its utilization has been mimicked and copied for centuries. The idea of a baby - something that is new and pure; complete innocence. These two ideas create an interpretation of what is new to the eye today, what is pure, with the overwhelming pressure of thousands of artists whom have come before us. These ideas also question what beauty means and what we as artists and designers define as beauty and how we strive to perfect our interpretation of it and how we attempt at projecting those ideas to the world.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_4">
	<h1>DELIVERABLES</h1><p>This system consists of an “art book” and a screen print. As stated previously, the book is an exploratory piece questioning the originality of design and artistic thought in todays’ world. My intent was to visualize the different standards of beauty and art with my current lens and aesthetic. I hope for these elements to serve as a thesis for my own definition of art and aesthetic - fused with those of our predecessors.</p>
    <p>The print serves more as a test of working with so many visual elements, of trying to create a balanced piece where each element can also work alone. The print piece focuses more on these ideas but to me personally – I have placed myself within the piece as “Ness”, a character from Super Smash Brothers (the child in the bottom left).</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_4">
	<h1>PROCESS</h1><p>The definition of art that I have conceived through looking at inspiration as well as points of memory from my past have led me to define successful art for myself as art that transports the viewer, a space where one is able to escape to for a amount of time - where the viewer is completely entranced by the medium and is able to fully experience it without distractions from our world. I began by exploring key civilizations throughout history with an emphasis on the cultures’ ideology of beauty and aesthetics and interpreted them presenting my view on predeceasing beauty in a way I think is beautiful. </p>
