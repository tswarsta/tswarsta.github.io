    <div id="img-container"><p> For this project we were given a transcript based on a podcast by “This American Life”. Our task - to take this transcript that describes a walking tour of the Lower 9th Ward, 10 years after Hurricane Katrina and bring it’s text to life by utilizing expressive typography to visualize and depict what the subjects are saying and feeling.

<p><br>I tried to visualize the key concept of each subject in a individual booklet; I did not want to create one book because I wanted each of the subjects to have their own space to articulate and visualize their story. All of the booklets have something to do with going back in time, of rewinding, or reliving a moment. Even though the hurricane happened ten years ago, these individuals will never forget the hurricane and how it effected their lives, no matter how hard they try.</p>
<br>   
<img src="lower9th+10th/intro.gif" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br>
<br>
<p>The first of the five booklets is the introduction, it begins to describe to the reader how type will be manipulated. Throughout the book there will be the interviewer - which is displayed in a aligned monospace type - this is because I did not want the user to focus on the interviewer, but instead solely on the subject. There is also my personal voice which is the larger monospace type - I use this when I want the viewer to pause.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p id='photocaption'>Introducing the reader to the subject's yelling voice</p>
<br>    
<p>The subject, who has three voices - regular, yelling and the whispers. The yells are horrifying parts of the interviews and I tried to illustrate the shakiness that you can hear in the yells. Each booklet has been written by a different individual. </p>
<br>   
<img src="selectspreads/introfinal4.png" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br>
<p id='photocaption'>Introducing the reader to the subject's whispering voice</p>
<br> 
<p>If you’re not concentrating hard enough, you might even miss the whispers. These, however, are often the most powerful - these messages are almost haunting. They are not chaotic like the yells, they are soft - the subject breaks down and their voice often cracks or shakes.</p>
 <br>   
<img src="lower9th+10th/kirk.gif" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br><br>
<p>The first booklet is based on the life of Kirk Washington and how constant reminders of his past and of the hurricane plague his daily routine. His story is that of trying to move on. The story of trying to leave the past behind, however, no matter what he does, he is constantly transported back to the night the hurricane hit.</p>
<br>   
<img src="selectspreads/kirk2.jpg" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br>
<p id='photocaption'>Graphics were created by dragging items across a scanner</p>
<br>
<p>For this project we were also tasked with utilizing over thirty items that were meant to symbolize items left behind during Hurricane Katrina. I decided to treat them as floating objects and memories distorted by the trauma that occurred.</p>
<br>   
<img src="selectspreads/kirk3.png" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br>
<p id='photocaption'>This spread contains all three of the subject’s voice that will be present throughout the system</p>
<br>
<p>For Kirk’s story I also wanted to play with the idea of constantly being transported back in time and of repetition. This is why in Kirk’s booklet there are pages that constantly repeat the same statement, like the two spreads above.</p>
<br>   
<img src="selectspreads/kirk5.png" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br>
<p id='photocaption'>One of ways I tried to illustrate the repetition of whispers and how they are meant to resonate with the reader through expressive typography</p>
<br>
<p>The repeated shakiness and troubled tone that is present in Kirk’s voice throughout the podcast is also something I wanted to visualize. Again the idea of constantly being reminded of the past.</p>
<br>   
<img src="lower9th+10th/jean.gif" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br><br>   
<p>Jean Gibson has had everything taken away from her - her family, her house, her job - everything. Gibson constantly tries to look forward. Everyday she wakes up, everyday is a new day, everyday she hopes for her old life back - she is slowly coming to terms with the idea that it is not coming back.</p>
 <br>
<img src="selectspreads/jean3.png" res width="65%" height="100%" >

<img src="selectspreads/jean4.png" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br>
<br>
<img src="selectspreads/jean5.png" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br>
<p id='photocaption'>The statement being spread out across multiple pages will cause the user to go through them then return to the original page to finish the section, I did this to mimic the repetition in Gibson’s life</p>
<br>
<p>Jean Gibson’s story is one of looking forward, of hoping for your past to be your present - only to have your dreams crushed every single morning. I wanted to visualize this by forcing the user into flipping forward several pages in the book just to realize that the same message is being repeated. This was my idea of mimicking Gibson’s harsh reality.</p>
<br> 
<img src="selectspreads/jean6.png" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br>
<br>
<p>The harsh reality that her old life will never come back. </p>
<br> 
<img src="lower9th+10th/roy.gif" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br><br>  
<p>A unconscious step back in time. Rewinding is the story of Roy Bradley’s loss of everything - of having a reset on life.</p>
<br>
<img src="selectspreads/roy3.png" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br>
<p id='photocaption'>The illegible text within this spread are exerts of Bradley’s whispers, this with the repeated “he needs help” statement allude to the overwhelming sense of helplessness he carries</p>
<br>
<p>The story of a failed dream. Bradley wanted to move up in the world and he was moving up - until the storm. The storm ruined everything. His house was taken away. His belongings, gone. His dreams - dead.</p>
<br>
<img src="selectspreads/roy6.png" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br>
<br>
<img src="selectspreads/roy10.png" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br>
<br>
<p>I really wanted to play with the overwhelming sense of debt, that overshadowed Bradley’s story - the feeling of utter helplessness.</p>
 <br>   
<img src="lower9th+10th/children.gif" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br><br> 
<p>The last booklet, unlike the previous is seen in a more positive light. The individuals talk about the future, about how the tragic event was strengthening for the family. I thought it would be fitting to end the series on this note as these are the voices of the future, not of the past. These conversations remind us to always look foreward. 
</p>

<img src="selectspreads/bookletsphoto.png" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br><br> 
<p>Because we were given content formatted into a transcript, I really wanted to stick with the idea that the text came from conversations and not try to force it into a medium it was not. I liked the idea of sound waves and how they can crack or ripple and this is where the core inspiration for my booklets came.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p id='photocaption'>Select spreads throughout the series showing the different treatments of expressive typography</p>
<br> 
<p>I wanted to also separate the content into booklets because I wanted to have clear breaks between subjects. I wanted each subject to have their own space, where I could uniquely visualize their stories through type, but keep it consistent with the rest of the system.</p>
<br>
<img src="selectspreads/spreadchange.gif" res width="65%" height="100%" >
<br>
<p id='photocaption'>Process of formatting margins as well as iterations of the characters voices and type</p>
<br> 
<p>One of the biggest issues I had was how to have all these different elements without overwhelming the viewer. This was difficult as I had a lot of ideas that I wanted to implement. In the end I decided to try and keep the margins more rigid in order to create more consistent pages. I also largely decreased the sizes of the yells so they would not draw so much attention. </p>
<br>
<img src="selectspreads/printingerrors.gif" res width="65%" height="100%" > 
<br>
<p id='photocaption'>Select photographs of printing errors throughout the series</p>
<br>
<p>Instead of adding velum pages throughout I also decided to use a thinner paper that made a sound when flipped that mimicked the sound of waves and water, I had to compromise for dimmer colors but I like the end result. The printing errors throughout and the rippling of pages reminded me of the sound waves that inspired me from the beginning.</p>
