        <p>For this project we were tasked with branding a full system of deliverables to promote “Paint the Pavement”, an organization whose goal is to bring communities together in lower income areas by building connections between artists, organizations and neighborhood residents. Our challenge was to assist users in apply for and understanding the large application process that the organization requires as well as attracting and informing neighborhood <a name="strategy"></a>communities.</p></div>
    
       <div data-scroll-speed="10">
           <p style="padding-top:37vh">The first deliverable users will interact with - the “how to” guide.</p></div>

            <p style="padding-top:30vh">This is how I planned to draw community leaders and members into the organization; the system would be sent to community leaders who would utilize them to guide them through the process of spreading the word, the large pamphlet would also be distributed throughout the community.<a name="deliverables"></a> </p></div>

        <p style="padding-top:50vh">My system has been designed for and inspired by Pittsburgh to align with the organization's goal of bringing people together and creating a sense of unity, place and identity.</p>
        <div data-scroll-speed="10">
            <p style="padding-top:50vh">The cheat sheet contains information that can be repeated at the sticker walls, information that will help draw users into the program</p></div>

            <p style="padding-top:68vh">The graphic inspired by a map of the Pittsburgh river and street as well as the logo for the branded system functions as a way-finding system, guiding the user through the information in a more systematic way while breaking down the information into more digestible pieces. The graphic that I have developed is also a huge component of the overall visual identity and system.</p></div>
        <div data-scroll-speed="10">
            <p style="padding-top:10vh">The main part of my system, this pamphlet hold information on how to actually apply, as well as reminders and guides to keep you organized</p></div>
          
        
            
         <div data-scroll-speed="10">
             <p style="padding-top:100vh">The last part of the system is the actual application. For the application I utilized the same system and hierarchal decisions that are utilized throughout, however, simplified so the user can focus on the application - not the visual elements.</p></div>
            
             
            <div data-scroll-speed="10">
                <p style="padding-top:80vh"><a name="process"></a>Using the design of roads as reference, I attempted different mark-making techniques, resulting in my watermark being inspired by the design of roads, hence the “e”. It later went on to influence my type system, the hierarchy throughout as well as the way-finding system I developed for the deliverables. </p></div>
            
            <div data-scroll-speed="10">
                <p style="padding-top:50vh">The last challenge I had to overcome was creating a way-finding system that would assist the user in going through the deliverables as well as make my print pieces more dynamic. I developed a graphic inspired by road design as well as the Pittsburgh map. I try to use the yellow and white lines throughout the pamphlet and print pieces to guide the reader. </p></div>

    <p><a name="info"></a>CONTEXT</p><p>For this project we were tasked with branding a full system of deliverables to promote “Paint the Pavement”, an organization whose goal is to bring communities together in lower income areas by building connections between artists, organizations and neighborhood residents. Our challenge was to assist users in apply for and understanding the large application process that the organization requires as well as attracting and informing neighborhood communities.</p> 

	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_4">
	<p>STRATEGY</p><p>My strategy was to target leaders of the community – these individuals would have a connection to the community already and would be more willing to put in the time and effort the application and organization required. These members would then spread the message with the designs I have provided.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_4">
	<p>DELIVERABLES</p><p>The first deliverable guides users through setting up a “sticker wall” – a fun way for members of the community to interact with one another, as well as a time for users to find out more about the organization.

The second is a sort of cheat sheet, also meant for those who want to promote and recruit members of the community – the verbal buy in, in our project brief we were given a document with text that we fully had to incorporate into our system. 

The Large pamphlet, which holds the majority of the content, is what would be distributed to the greater community. This pamphlet explains to users the process of applying as well as key beneficial factors of the program. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_4">
	<p>PROCESS</p><p>The first step of this project was to create a wordmark and to brand the system. This wordmark is meant to explain the concept and act as groundwork, inspiring and serving as the backbone of the system. Due to the large amount of information our second task was to go through our given copy and create a sort of hierarchy for it. What was the most important? How would we capture the audience? These made me start to think of a modular type of system, where one of my deliverables would lead to another and another. This process gave me more insight into the project and allowed me to start throwing around concept ideas in my head. By creating different “modules”/ by grouping the information, my goal was to make the information more easily digestible.</p>
