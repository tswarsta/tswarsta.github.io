    <h1>CONTEXT</h1><p>Functioned as a integrated member of the studio and worked on a broad range of systems and deliverables ranging from printed to web matter. Worked on projects at different phases between ideation and implementation.</p>
<p>Select client work includes AdAge, Dartmouth, ESPNW, Rice Architecture and Studio Museum Harlem. Acted as a project lead for NYU Leadership Week and Run for Something.<br><br>VIEW STUDIO - <a href="https://www.originalchampionsofdesign.com" target="_blank">ocdagency.com</a></p>
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_4">
	<h1>INTENT</h1><p> On my first day of work I was given the task of preparing assets for the OCD website; this consisted of editing photos as well as photoshopping them within templates — on my first day I began functioning as an integral member of the eight person studio. During my time I worked with all of the designers in the studio as a designer, I was handed off tasks from different projects and was asked to manage my time well and work on three to four projects at any given time. At OCD the design process began with market research and intentions of the client, this was then presented to the client to confirm certain goals of the project and behaviors. This then led to beginning iterations and presentations, which I often combined into presentable decks. </p>

	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_4">

	<h1>DELIVERABLES</h1><p>For the AdAge work, I worked closely with Dan Hennessy to create over 1000 wireframes — AdAge’s new website that would function across breakpoints. Other components of the identity system were worked on by other members of the studio, however, in addition to the wireframes I worked on collateral deliverables.</p><p>I also worked with Hanah Ho and David Shatan-Pardo on projects for ESPNW, Dartmouth, Rice Architecture, Studio Museum Harlem and NYU Leadership Week. I was required to create deliverables that worked within an already created system, making sure the collateral was consistent with the identities. For Run For Something I acted as a project leader, allowing me to make design decisions and present to the partners my ideas.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_4">
	<h1>PROCESS</h1><p>At OCD I had to work extremely effectively as OCD is a small studio. I think working in a small studio taught me the importance of working quickly and effectively — it was important to create thoughtful, meaningful and effective designs in short timeframes while balancing several projects. It was my first time working in a studio and I think a small studio gave me the opportunity to make a lot of my own decisions. </p><p>Working on large client projects for the first time gave me an idea of what types of work are effective and appealing to clients as well as proper ways of explaining, organizing and presenting ideas. I am extremely grateful for my time at OCD as it has created a sense of rigor and motivation within my design process.</p>
