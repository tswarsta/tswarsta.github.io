<p><strong id='projecttitle'>Feedback</strong>
    </p><div id="img-container"><p> Robots can emulate living organisms through programed taxis, behavioral responses to certain stimuli. In this case, we have created a feedback loop which is composed of three “line-phillic” or line following robots that also modify their environment. Our goal was to observe how they interact with the environment and each other. Starting with a simple loop, the robots will modify the loop by drawing or erasing parts of it. The robots augment deviations caused by features in the way the robots follow and modify the line, creating Feedback. </p></div>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/146071961">Feedback</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/treatswarstad">Treat Swarstad</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
        
        
<p><br>Our intention was to imbue robots with characteristics that are found in living organisms, not unlike Braitenberg vehicles, and to create meaningful the emergent properties from simple rules. Feedback represents humans’ ability to modify our own environments; modi cations are often easy enough to execute, but difficult to reverse and ultimately snowball into a bigger problem. The actors in our simulation are three line following 3pi robots, two with erasers and one with a pen with which to draw on the whiteboard.</p>
<p><br>
Our original intention was to have two line-phobic drawing robots and one line following eraser. However, line-phobic robots were hard to manage; they tended to fall off or get stuck in loops, as there was not enough “line” to create a followable white space. The erasing robot also moved slower than the drawing so the two drawing to one erasing ration was too high. For the final, all robots were line following and the ratio was one drawing to two erasing. Nonetheless, Feedback turned out to be quite successful. We started the robots out with a loop and then allowed the three robots to follow it and more importantly - alter it. The outcome proved to be quite interesting - it was very clear that the “polluter” was altering the environment more aggressively than the two robots that had attached erasers. In the end we were left with an interesting path that deviated greatly from the original line. In future iterations, we would consider other mediums, such as grass/fertilizer, black paint/white paint, or crumbs/vacuums.

<p><br>Our idea for this project was to develop a product that would remind users to consume water, a reminder to stay hydrated. To sense if water had been consumed we decided to attach a plate to a bend sensor, which read the weight of the water bottle and transmitted it to an arduino through a load cell amp. Our code allows us to weight the water bottle placed on our product over an extended amount of time, if the weight does not change over a certain period, (this period can be set to anytime, for demonstration purposes it was placed on five seconds, however, it would probably placed at fifteen to twenty minutes in real time), our product will begin to vibrate until the water bottle is removed; the vibration is caused through a vibrator, which was attached to the arduino. </p>

<p><br>Our main object for this project was to create a mechanism that allows the auto-adjustment of an ear set to its surroundings. Our idea addresses the needs of users who enjoy listening to music, but would still like to be aware of their surroundings. This product is meant for any commuter who would like to listen to music but still be “connected” to its response – for example the user’s music will decrease in volume if sound levels increase around the box.</p><br>
