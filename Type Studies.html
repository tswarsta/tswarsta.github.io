<p><br>Univers is a san-serif designed by Adrian Frutiger. In order to concisely portray the essence of Univers I knew I would have to capture its simplistic style that had, “visual sensitivity between thick and thin strokes”, which characterizes Univers as a not strictly geometric typeface. 
Reflecting on my design, if I were to iterate further I would remove the extreme focus on the geometric quality Univers has and extend research into its curvature because Frutiger’s aim was not to create another geometric typeface, which were extremely popular during the era. but one that was not rigid and part of a common school of thought.

<p1 id='photocaption'>Process showing the family and the selected key traits of the family</p1><br><br>
<p>I began by first exploring the family I was assigned - Univers 39 thin ultra condensed. I then took key characteristics of the family and placed them into boxes. </p><br>

<p1 id='photocaption'>The final grids that I utilized to inspire and explain Univers in my animation</p1><br><br>
<p>With the selected characteristics I created a 3 x 3 grid of the traits that are meant to describe the family individually but also work as a grid. I wanted to keep the video as simple as possible as Univers can be described as rather minimalistic, however, I still wanted to show how many facets it had and the amount of different weights and style available in the family.</p><br>

<p><br>Our final design is inspired by the constellations. We titled it Astral, influenced by “Arial” but applied to the stars.</p><br>

<p>We decided that the hole punch alone was not enough to create a legible typeface, we experiment with weaving thread through the holes, but we decided that cutting thin slits through the holes looked much cleaner.</p>

<p>The geometric look of this led us to creating a digital version of our typeface, where we were able to play with the location of the dots and the volume of the lines much easier.</p>
