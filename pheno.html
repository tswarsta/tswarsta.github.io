    <h1>CONTEXT</h1><p>The Declaration of Independence [TDIC] states, “that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these,“are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”. This document hand-scripted in 1776, has served as a bible to our nation for centuries where its’ beliefs and ideologies aligned with those of that time, pronouncing equal unalienable rights for humanity. The literal creation of TDIC serves as Pheno’s inspiration, it serves as a symbol of the past, a symbol that must and should be questioned in order for it to continue its purpose of serving the people, for the people. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_4">
	<h1>INTENT</h1><p>Focusing on the craft and formation of the scripts utilized, Pheno is an attempt at defying the limitations of the craftsman. Looking at the anatomy of traditionally written scripts, Pheno’s intent is to challenge the rules that have guided these scripts for centuries and in hand challenge the information they carry. The 56 signatures at the bottom of the document have inspired Pheno’s core. How each mark is unique, how some are physically larger — how these 56 signatures have led to and have established law. Pheno’s DNA allows for no letter to be more important than another — this is a reinterpretation of the traditional rules that have guided such scripts for centuries and questions the freedom of the individual in today’s digital society.

	<div class="col span_1_of_4">

	<h1>DELIVERABLES</h1><p>Pheno aims to function in a high stakes environment and to serve as a tool capable of broadcasting and advocating content. As a society, we must defend our freedom of expression at all costs. Pheno— the first division and catalyst of an essential phenomenon, is the first section of the word “phenomenon”. Pheno recognizes the need for a phenomenon, but is not the phenomenon. Pheno proposes a ratified chain of command where the user is enabled to bravely state his or her beliefs. Pheno stands for dissolving the system of homogeneity and presenting a message of bravery, boldness and rebellion.</p>

	<div class="col span_1_of_4">
	<h1>PROCESS</h1><p>Pheno is a ongoing typeface and collection of type specimens created over the course of fall 2017 as an independent study with professor Kristin Hughes. Pheno is the first typeface I have worked on and was, as an entity, larger than expected. I began by searching for inspiration – this came due to the circumstances of studying in the United States, and the political climate we are currently in. I then worked for over three months doing research and creating the letterforms. The letterforms went through over twelve iterations, each presented at the beginning of the week. There were parts that I found extremely difficult; throughout the process I had to learn new skills and motives. There were also parts where I homogenized the letters too much and I lost a lot their character – it was a constant battle between intent and development.</p>
