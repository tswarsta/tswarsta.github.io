<p1 id='projecttitle'>Fruit Packaging</p1><br><p1 id='subtitle'>Graphic/ Product Design</p1><br><br>
    <div id="img-container"><p> For this project we were placed into pairs and were tasked with designing cohesive fruit packaging for one another. My partner and I selected a kiwi and a grapefruit. </p><br></div>

    <div id="img-container">
    <img src="colorstudies/fruitcontext.jpg" res width="65%" height="50%"  pl><br><p id='photocaption'>Our final product took form as a acetate bag with two trays containing the fruit housed within</p>   
         
<p><br>My partner and I’s inspiration came from the literal essence of the fruit. We scanned the fruit as well as took photos of sliced fruit on a light board to come up with our “print”, which is of a grapefruit and a kiwi.</p><br>

    <div id="img-container">
        <img src="colorstudies/colorzine.gif" res width="65%" height="50%"  pl>   <br><p id='photocaption'>The trays had our fruit design printed on them with a acetate casing over them that also featured the prints</p>    </div>   
        
<p><br>After we completed our packaging we designed a zine to go with it. The zine included more playful context shots as well as my partner and I interacting with the finished design
</p><br>
<p id='subtitle'>Process</p><br>

<div id="img-container">
<img src="colorstudies/fruitprocess1.gif" res width="65%" height="50%"  pl>  </div>
<p id='photocaption'>Process showing the transition to digital</p><br>
<p>My partner and I were inspired by the idea of fruit being placed on a surgical table, which is why we started with photographs of the fruit on a light board, this however, seemed to far from appetizing so we moved to printing making with the sliced fruit and eventually moved to the digital.</p><br>
<div id="img-container">
<img src="colorstudies/fruitprocess2.gif" res width="65%" height="50%"  pl>  </div>   <p id='photocaption'>Iterations showing the transition from typical prints to our final halftone version</p>  <br>
<p>My partner and I were unsatisfied at this point as our iterations seamed to be dated, we questioned the definition of a traditional print or pattern at this point and began to focus on a single fruit. We began to manipulate this, which resulted in our end result.</p>

 <p1 id='projecttitle'>The Colors of Phipps</p1><br><p1 id='subtitle'>Graphic Design/ Print</p1><br><br>
    <div id="img-container"><p> Inspiration and photographs taken at the nearby Phipps Conservatory - how can we use color to tell a story and to change the mood of an environment? </p><br></div>

<div id="img-container">
<img src="colorstudies/colorofphipps.gif" res width="65%" height="50%"  pl>   <br><p id='photocaption'>The finish product is a three by 3 inch per square booklet</p>
   

<p><br>I wanted to utilize color to transport the viewer into a different environment. Phipps has many different rooms with plants from many different parts of the globe with many different temperatures. I wanted to take the user on a journey through temperatures and climate by using the lines and color of plants to tell my story.

<div id="img-container">
    <img src="colorstudies/phippsprocess1.png" res width="65%" height="50%"  pl><p id='photocaption'>Process shows iterations of transition from plant to plant as well as the colors selected for their backgrounds</p>
<br><p>I began by sifting through the images I had taken at a walk through Phipps. The first thing that I was drawn to were the interesting or severe angles some of the plants had - this is where I got my inspiration for the transitions from. I placed them side by side to see if they could create some kind of organic flow from plant to plant.</p>
<div id="img-container">
    <img src="colorstudies/phippsprocess2.png" res width="65%" height="50%"  pl><p id='photocaption'>Process showing the integration of chalk pastel</p><br>
    <p>After being satisfied with the transitions I moved into blending the background and foreground. I didn’t want there to be abrupt shifts from the gradients I selected in the back and the plants in the front - this is where I utilized chalk pastel to fuse the two.</p><br>
